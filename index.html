                                During my year abroad in Canada and the USA, I had the opportunity to work in a hotel in Tofino on Vancouver Island and a bike shop in Vancouver. With the money I earned, I was able to explore the country and see its breathtaking beauty, such as the Rocky Mountains and the stunning islands of Hawaii. Additionally, I was fortunate to meet people from various cultures and backgrounds, which provided me with a new perspective on life. This experience was a defining moment for me and has helped shape me into the person I am today.

                            <h3>Surfing</h3>
                            <p>Surfing has been my passion since I first started in the chilly waves of the Pacific Ocean along Vancouver Island's coastline. Despite the less-than-ideal conditions for learning to surf in Canada, I was immediately hooked. When I'm out there riding the waves, everything else fades away, and I'm fully immersed in the present moment. Beyond the sheer enjoyment of surfing, I've also found that it offers valuable life lessons. Sometimes you have to put in a lot of effort just to catch one wave, but the reward is always worth it. Through surfing, I've had the incredible opportunity to explore some of the most beautiful places in the world, from Hawaii to Morocco, Portugal, and France.
